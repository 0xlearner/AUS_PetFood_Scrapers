He has had flakey itchy skin.  I went to a pet store to see if they could recommend a shampoo that would take care of the issue.  The team member explained that he could have a food allergy and mentioned the food I had been giving him is one of the worst.  Saddened by the fact that I could have been contibuting to his problem, she gave me a couple of containers of food to try.  That evening I gave him his dinner, but he sniffed it and walked away mad! I gave him his not so good food so he would not go to bed hungry, but started researching other options.  This is when I discovered fresh pet and decided to give it a try.  I chose the beef and bison recipe because I was told if a dog has a food allergy, 90% of the time it is chicken.  He gobbled his dinner up like he had never eaten before.  His skin cleared up within a few weeks and his fur is shiny again!  I absolutely love that he loves his food and that it cleared up the issues he was having.

Despite having no teeth, her previous owner had her on dry kibble. Obviously that had to change, so I switched her over to wet food Immediately. After a few months I noticed she just was not progressing like I wanted her to, and the quality of the brand I was using was so inconsistent. So I decided to look into Freshpet, having no experience with feeding fresh, I was a little nervous. It’s been a month now, and when I tell you I have cried watching her thrive on this stuff I’m not exaggerating. Her allergies are starting to get better, her coat is softer, and she’s finally putting on weight. She doesn’t even look like the same dog anymore. We are even saving money on dog food now! And I always though fresh would be more expensive XD. Thank you Freshpet for helping me give my girl the quality of life she deserves <3",Y,17,263

Our family truly thought it was the end of her 12 year old life. We were devastated. As a last ditch effort, we researched alternative diets and found out our neighborhood pet store offered Freshpet. With Bubbles’ very first serving, she ate the recommended portion and licked her bowl clean. We were amazed! She has since recovered, needs less insulin to keep her sugar regulated and is back to her old self.

Oh myGod, my 16 lbs dog was so anxious and smelling the food as I was slicing and using my food chopper to break it up in small squares. He loved it!!! Well, I waited a few days to see if he would vomit or have loose bowel, but no sight of any sickness and his bowels were firm! Eureka! I finly can mix his dry food with wet food. I went and and chopped the rest of the Bison roll into small square and put food dosage amount into sandwich bags. I froze the other half into freezer bags and he loves the frozen squares as well!!

He's been very picky about wet foods, over the last year the trend has been he'll eat one serving and then decide it's not worth eating the 2nd or 3rd time. I had grabbed this tube and a back of food from the fridge section.
He absolutely loved this one! So much that he begged for more, which he hasn't done, he ate the whole medium tube within two days. To see him so eager to eat has been amazing. 
I would describe the texture as that of liverwurst, it is very solid, you can see the blueberries. He likes two slices cubed up and heated for 10 seconds to take the chill out.",N,17,263

He had been hit by a car and dumped by his owners. After $10,000 in surgery to replace his pelvis, I was contacted by the rescue to adopt him. I had waited over one year to find a frenchie. Little did I know, Ka$h came with some extra health issues. He is severely allergic to chicken. ALL forms of it. SO allergic, ALL of my animals had to be put on a completely chicken free diet. Ka$h HATED the food recommended by my vet. We reached an understanding with another brand but it was fish based and he didn't like it. I decided to try Vital in the Beef & Bison. It was a WINNER! Not only are the sores on Ka$h finally healing BUT he now LOOKS FORWARD to feeding time! I can't thank you enough for making my boy not only healthy but ALSO HAPPY! Ka$h is the 2nd dog I've owned that required special food. Vital saved BOTH of my dogs from suffering and ALSO didn't break my budget. You all are a blessing and I hope you continue to expand your line. If there are any completely chicken free treats, I would love to hear about them. Ka$h cannot even have chicken fat as an ingredient. He would HAPPILY volunteer as a ""taste tester"" for any completely poultry free treat products that you may intend to launch in the future!

He had a very sensitive stomach from the get go. We always tried to feed him high protein, high quality kibble, which he did best on. Unfortunately we experienced more than one brand start with a good quality recipe to build the reputation and trust then over time sneakily change the ingredients to cheaper recipe for same big price. Usually we found out when his stomach started acting up. One thing my boy always liked is eating, but recently he started leaving a portion in the bowl and suddenly stopped eating any dry dog food offered. In desperation we tried cooking him human grade meats (chicken, steak, lean ground beef), which he ate once then refused the next time. We ran out of things to offer and thought we would have to take him to the vet to say goodbye. Then my stepdad said √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwhat about the refrigerated dog food you see at the stores?√¢‚Ç¨√π We thought it was a long shot if he wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat steak, but we were desperate and wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let him starve himself and knew he couldn't live on hamburgers anyway. We offered him the Freshpet Vital Beef & Bison roll and to our amazement and pure joy he wolfed it down...not just once, but every day for the last two weeks so far. He is no longer on his NSAID for arthritis and he has gotten a lot of spunk back. He meets us bright eyed at the door again, which he hadn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t done for over a month.

The last few years it had gotten much worse having to add dog broth, roast beef or anything else that would entice him to eat his food. I certainly did not want to start giving him table food since it would not have all his necessary nutrients. That's when I took note of an advertisement for Freshpet. Tried a small roll of the Beef &amp; Bison (unfortunately he cannot eat chicken), mixed a little with his kibble, he picked out all the Freshpet and meal time has taken on a whole new meaning. He gets up at about 5:30 in the morning, goes out, comes in, gets his meds and starts barking up a storm if his Freshpet isn't ready. Food down and gone in 60 seconds!

One of the grain free ones had chicken and they were so allergic to it or whatever way it was processed. They began losing their fur in different spots as a result. I think my dogs knew that it was making them I'll so they quit eating it(they're so smart).

They were discolouring her fur, and even extensive cleaning would not remove them. We bought several different wipes and cleaning solutions, which we applied once or twice daily. We bought a filter and tried only giving her filtered water. We consulted our vet, who thought antibiotics might work, but did not encourage their use for a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìcosmetic√¢‚Ç¨√π problem. We removed all colour additives from her food and her treats. The problem continued for two years, and the fur around our dog√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s eyes only got darker and darker to the point that even taking her to the dog groomer√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s would not remove the stains.Then, we switched to FreshPet.

A year before that she was diagnosed with Cushings Disease. She takes Vetroyl for Cushings and she is currently on her 5th treatment of Chemo. The issue was that we needed a low carb, low phosphorus food for her as cancer feeds off carbs and due to her Cushings her kidney values were high. My sister recommended this food as she had a dog with cancer and it was the only food her dog would eat. My Lou Lou would normally eat anything as most labs do, however with the Chemo I think her sense of smell and or taste was off hence she was turning her nose up at everything until I tired Freshpet Vital Beef and Bison. Now she eats all her food and her recent blood test reveled that her Kidney values are back to normal. The vet even asked what I did differently, I told him Fresh Pet and even emailed him the link with the nutritional values on it so he can recommend it to future clients that maybe in the same predicament as I with Lou Lou. I cannot thank you enough from the bottom of my heart. Its easy to buy, I don't have to order it online, easy to serve, made in the USA and best of all it is helping her.

Of course she loved chicken and rice and many other home cooked meals, but would she receive all the vitamins she would get in professionally prepared food. I tried the one Freshpet brand and she would eat a little and then not so much. Tried another and so forth until we found the Vital Bison and Beef. She loved it and now 7 years later, she is a tiny bit overweight--maybe and thriving. So the Vital Bison and Beef are Vital to our lives. When we can't get it, I start to panic and Angel and I are MOST unhappy. It is the only food that she will eat consistently. So Thanks for such a great product.

Dandie is one of the pickiest eaters on the ""Dailey dog"" planet.But once introduced to Beef &amp; Bison by Fresh pet, our ward Molly's dinner, he was not going back to Science Diet or Precise canned. His choice has improved his incidence of tummy upset and lower GI irritability and his coat glistens. He is satisfied. I haven't tried the other flavors. I find him waiting to be fed instead of grazing on crunchy carbs that he's really not interested in for the most part. He's not sharing, lol and happily eats his portion.",N,17,263
Freshpet® Vital™Grain Free Beef & Bison Adult Dog Food,4.82262996941896,Reenie,09-09-2015,So amazed!!!,"I am thrilled beyond belief!! I have 3 Shih tzu's and they are the pickiest eaters, I have tried every food and I practically had to hand feed, well I bought the vital grain free beef, on the very first try they ate very willingly, and now when I ask if they're hungry they actually run to their bowls and wait for the food. Never in my life would I ever think that this day would come. BTW their ages are 4-14 yrs old. Thank you thank you!!!",N,17,263
Freshpet® Vital™Grain Free Beef & Bison Adult Dog Food,4.82262996941896,Willow's,06-29-2015,Ms. Willow Rose,"My extremely spoiled rotten Great Dane (Female, 6 years old, 140 lbs.) tends have issues with eating from time to time. She starts out LOVING a food then slowly starts to loose interest in it or worse we find a food she likes and soon find out she's allergic to an ingredient or ends up with GI issues !!! Our lives changed 2 years ago when we discovered some heart &amp; lung damage from heart worms had occurred. Crazy part is it was due to not digesting the heartworm preventive... It would pass through her digestive system too quickly this was due to the diet she was on. Our vet recommended a Bison formula due to its great heart &amp; GI bennifits. Seems easy enough except for the fact that I'm extremely picky about food due to past dogs as well as her showing signs of food as well as environmental allergies. I was lucky to have found Solid Gold Wolf King unfortunately being on so many restrictions meant fewer ""treats"". That is until we found Vital grain free beef &amp; bison reciepe. I normally would not have even attempted to try something new due to her past problems, but the fact that it was such limited ingredients made it worth the effort. What started out as a simple ""treat"" has turned into a MUST HAVE in this house. I am so very grateful to have found this when I did bc it became a total life saver a few weeks ago when she had to have an emergency stomach surgery/gastropexy. The vet tried numerous things to get her to start eating again after surgery with no avail. In true fashion the only thing she would attempt was the one thing that causes allergy flair ups, baked chicken. We knew we needed her to eat but we also knew if we didn't get her off the chicken she was going to be fighting a bigger battle. And then it hit me..... Why not try her FAVORITE ""treat"" !!! Although a bit pricey, we were already on borrowed time with our girl and we needed to act fast and her well being was more important than money, but turned out to be well worth the extra expense. We ran to the nearest store that carried the vital rolls and rushed back to her side and within minutes she found her will to eat again !!!! It was such a joyish moment to know we had found something that would help her pull through the hardest thing she has ever been faced with. She is currently eating just the beef &amp; bison roll as her main source of food which has also helped her water intake bc we are able to mix with some water to make a type of soft mix and get both food and water in her at the same &amp; time, which has prevented her from becoming dehydrated as well. The vet was so impressed with how well she was doing to the Vital roll she was able to come home 2 days sooner than most dogs who have this particular surgery. I really can't say enough WONDERFUL &amp; AMAZYING things about this product. I do know one thing and that is, that this is no longer a ""treat""..... It has now become part of her daily diet &amp; she absolutely LOVES it !!!! I owe her well being, as well as her desire to fight &amp; thrive though this difficult time to this food !!! It has helped in way more ways than I could have imagined. Her energy level is improving, her BMs have improved, she doesn't seem to have a loud angry tummy &amp; gas problems as frequent, and she's ALWAYS willing to eat now !!! Thank You for getting my baby to eat !!!",N,17,263
Freshpet® Vital™Grain Free Beef & Bison Adult Dog Food,4.82262996941896,Galgarrick,03-13-2015,A Love Affair Has Begun,"Carmella (Maltipoo), is very finicky and really only wanted to eat fresh roasted organic chicken breast... But I was concerned because chicken alone was a recipe for disaster and potential allergies... She would nibble at√Ç¬†organic kibble that I mixed in the chicken breast, but she wasn't all that excited and knew for a 3 year old dog she was NOT at her best. I had to supplement with a dog vitamin.On Valentines Day - my family went on a picnic (we brought our girl), the park was very dog friendly and we started chatting with a fellow dog (Maltese) owner... Her dog was also a PICKY eater - but not anymore!!!! She told us about Vital and we started feeding Carmella the next day!!! What a change - it has been wonderful and her little body seems to thrive now. Her coat is improving and the tearing around her eyes has subsided. Also her potties (#2's) are very healthy, no loose bowels, which was a real concern in the past. Thank you FRESHPET, I'm gonna start using your treats too!",N,17,263
Freshpet® Vital™Grain Free Beef & Bison Adult Dog Food,4.82262996941896,Gorgeous,03-10-2015,Bringing my boy back from the brink!,"My best buddy is was a rescue so his age and history are not well known. We think he is 9 or 10. He has blessed my life for 3 years. My vet found a heart murmur and last summer he went into sudden congestive heart failure. It was in July, in the middle of the high heat and my vet was honest; she said she didn't think he could survive the heat wave. He stopped eating, lost 6 lbs which is huge on a little guy and had to be hospitalized. I took him home thinking I would let him pass at home.He would not give up. He is such a fighter. He was a ""southern"" dog, found on the streets, had been shot with a bb gun and had a perfectly formed hole in his chest we found on xray. As we started him on heart meds, he hated it. Would not eat or take his meds. I was desperate. I spent at least $300 trying to find any food that would work in addition to his sky high vet and hospital bills. But if he wouldn't give up, why should I? I found this roll at Pet Supplies Plus, he has allergies on top of everything and thought, just try it. It was a miracle. Not embellishing. He ate it up like it was the last supper. I was able to sneak his meds in the food and his energy level exploded. He started looking like my little guy again. He pulled out of heart failure, gained weight back and he is still getting the Beef and Bison twice a day. I can give him his meds without a fuss or forcing the pills in him. As long as I have his roll cut up, he doesn't care what I put in there. His coat is healthy now, his teeth are back to normal and he has a spark in his eyes along with the energy level of a 4 year old! My vet is always in awe every time he has a check-up. She can't believe he survived. So, thank you for creating a food that allowed me to save my little guy, my best friend.",N,17,263
Freshpet® Vital™Grain Free Beef & Bison Adult Dog Food,4.82262996941896,Melanie,02-26-2015,Finally - Expensive but worth it!,"My boxer suffers from stomach issues to the point he's on medicine daily. He also has increased allergy issues with food. I've tried all foods from prescription (which he spit out!) to cheap (he'd eat but get diarrhea and ear/skin allergies from) and everything in between. I finally tried the Freshpet Beef &amp; Bison. Huge success!! He's excited to eat, eats his plate clean and no issues with his stomach or allergies. After only a week on the food we noticed a difference in his digestion. After a month on the food we notice how nice his coat and eyes are. His energy level is back (almost like having a puppy again!). Finally we found a food! It is expensive but worth it for my boy. Highly recommend especially for those with allergy &amp; stomach issues!",N,17,263

A year ago he began to exhibit significant digestive problems and was throwing up daily and having diarrhea. I was beside myself with worry and he began to refuse food, all food. Tiny, as he is, he lost 1/2 lb and became listless. I tried every dry dog food on the market - chicken, lamb, salmon, white ocean fish, turkey, duck, and even wild kangaroo meat. He refused all of it - and then blisters appeared all over his belly and genitals. He itched and chewed on himself constantly. Turns out, he had developed an allergy to grains, fresh chicken, foul, and chicken by products.WHO KNEW???I read about the Freshpet Vital refrigerated product line, crossed my fingers and tried him on the Grain Free Beef and Bison. He gobbled it up! And has continued to do so every day since.The pox-like blisters went away, the√Ç¬†itching stopped, he returned to his normal weight and regained his sweet temperament and energy ! What a wonderful product. He's happy... and so am I. Thanks for a perfect and healthy solution.",N,17,263

I combine a piece of the roll with the ""kibbley"" stuff Vital makes. Depending on where I am shopping and what's available, either the FreshPet Select or Vital she loves them all. The kitties come by to make sure she's cleaned her bowl. I sometimes will give them a little piece.

My dog loves all","If I could give this food more than 5 stars I would. Let me start by saying I have an 11 year old male Shitzu, Georgie. G was having some skin issues, similar to doggie eczema. He had hair loss and some lesions/dry skin areas. This food was recommended to me by another customer when I was at Petsmart. I brought it home and my dog went BANANAS for it! It is on the lower end of the protein scale (which is good for an older dog) and it has a high moisture content. I told my Vet all about my dogs new diet and when he saw the ingredients and vitamins etc he said ""WOW, THIS LOOKS FANTASTIC!"" Georgie was never the kind of dog to sit in the kitchen at 5pm and wait for dinner but, now he is. My 11 year old little man is like a puppy again. His energy is 5x what it was prior to this food. His hair is thick, and long and his skin is clear of lesions or any type of issue. This food has biotin in it and other vitamins that I think have been extremely beneficial to his health and wellbeing. I also highly recommend the Freshpet treats. According to Georgie, the turkey bacon is amazing! :)",N,17,263

I wish it had taurine in it ... I feed a LOT of cats with pre-IBD-type issues and this food is the only thing I’ve found that eliminates their throwing up. (The one pound cat food rolls are useless for my situation... I need monster rolls like the 6 lb dog rolls!) 
I do feed this to my cats but supplement with high quality dry food for their taurine and add extra supplements as well. Cats are not designed to digest carbs (dry food) so this is much better (and easier than cans!). Again, I know it does not have taurine in it which is why they still get some dry and supplements. 

They all love it and I go through A LOT of it each week! Instead of cutting it in chunks, I lop off a few lbs and grate it with a cheese grater. Works “grate” (great!) LOL! 

Test out different flavors and styles ... take it slow and give your pet time (a month or so) to adjust to new food ... it’s so much better for them than dry. Itty Bitty and I highly recommend it!",Y,100,419

We have to be very careful with what she eats as it will easily mess up her bowel movements for sometimes up to a week. We found success for a while with a grain free brand recommended for bulldogs. After a few months, her hair started thinning and she was putting on weight. She started having soreness in her hips. Many vet trips later we found out grain free food is not good for dogs after all!  They recommended x-rays to see if she had torn ligaments in one of her knees. Being on a tight budget, we scheduled an appointment 2 months down the road. In the meantime, we immediately switched up her diet to the Vital brands which contain brown rice. Within a month, her hair had started growing back in and she had lost all the weight. She was also walking on her leg again. We also included joint supplements into her diet and with restrictions on her physical activity to prevent any further soreness, she was back to normal by month two!",Y,100,419

I too have tried all sorts of dog foods, even the ones that say they are formulated especially for Chihuahuas and all to no avail.  We did find out she would eat cheap hot dogs, but I kept thinking these are not really healthy and since I love her, I wanted her to be healthy and stick around for awhile.  So in my never ending quest to find something she would eat, I bought a one pound roll of chicken select Freshpet and as soon as I cut her a 1/8 piece of the roll, chopped it up and put it down for her, she sniffed it a couple of times, looked at me and then took a tentative taste.  She went wild!  That was two weeks ago and she literally can't wait for mealtime now and is jumping on me the entire time I'm preparing her food.  After putting it down and pouring a cup of coffee for myself, she has licked her plate clean.  Thank you Freshpet.  ☺",Y,100,419

Symptoms low energy,  weak looking as well as weakness in joints, etc.  I started feeding this product to both my dogs and that was 4 years ago.  I only go to the vetranarian for vacations.

It is worth a little extra money for the peace of mind knowing that your family member (Dog or cat) is eating the best and most nutritious product out there. Our vet was astounded by the fact that he had slimmed down over the last six months. (That was completely unexpected) He eats the recommended serving for his size, and is extremely healthy and happy!

Freshpet® Vital™Balanced Nutrition Chicken Adult Dog Food,4.751497005988024,Ioana Sheldon,06-13-2019,Exceeded my expectation,"I have been feeding my senior dogs (8 1/2 bullmastiff suffering from arthritis and 12 year old shi-thzu) this food for a little over a month. They loved it from the first try. My goal was to get them to increase their energy level and in the mastiff's case to drop a bit of weight and increase mobility. I have reached all my goals. I've always fed my dogs a mix of homecooked meals ( chx and carrots) and an expensive kibble, however in the last year they seemed to slow down a bit and get tired on their walks faster than usual. I've done some research and decided to give this brand a try based on the positive reviews. I am very happy with the results: my dogs act like puppies again, they seem happier, they've got lots of energy, their coat looks and feels softer with minimal shedding and most of all they LOVE the food. My mastiff dropped a good 8-10 pounds in the first 3 weeks. She looks leaned and more fit. For those of you who don't know, a senior arthritic dog puts on weight fast despite watching their diet ( just like humans do due to inflammation). Since changing to Fresh Pet I did not have to give her her occasional Medicine for joint stiffness and inflammation. Her joints feel good and believe me I check them daily several times a day. This food gives me hope that I'll be able to enjoy my dogs for longer than if I'd continued to feed them like before. It just makes sense : as dogs get older they have different needs just like we do. They have to eat healthier and Fresh Pet makes it easy. Thank you to whoever invented this. You have a customer for life. God Bless you!",N,100,419

To our amazement, we gave her the recommended amount and before our eyes it was like her life was revived. Mine you, the vet said it would be up and down but this was up all the way. She may pass by the end of the year or even two weeks or not at all, but because of your food she has the vitality she needs to stay with us a little longer. We were contemplating euthanasia, but we have decided to just take one day at a time as she is not suffering. It seems that she is happier and eating up a storm. She loves your food. She is moving and walking so.much better. We truly believe that there is something in your food that helped her. We are not unrealistic, but believe me we were crying for a week because she had no strength and well, we thought we would have to say good bye. We still can't believe what we are seeing.

We have tried many foods to find one that did not create havoc with her blood sugar readings.

                    We check her BGL twice daily at a minimum and base our insulin dosage on those readings. We have been as high as 12 units twice daily.
                    
                    We tried Freshpet Vital the first time we saw it - that was August 26, 2016. We keep impeccable records. We transitioned off of kibble & canned food and onto Vital as her meal twice daily. When we began Freshpet, we were on 12 units of insulin twice daily. We immediately dropped to 6 units twice daily. That was almost 2 1/2 yrs ago.

She survived, but was left with neurological seizures and horrible GI trouble. I had to syringe feed her every 4 hours and she had to get phenobarbital twice a day. Our lives were like this the last 9 years! Finally, I picked up Freshpet Vital and offered it to her. I was astonished! Sabrina ate on her own for the first time in 9 years! She no longer suffered from the horrible GI upsets and seemed remarkably happy! Although, we lost our little Angel in March of this year to heart failure, Freshpet allowed her to finally live a normal life in her last year of eating and being happy.

We tried many different kinds of canned foods and they were all a hit or miss. What they would eat one day they would not eat the next. Then we got ""DELI FRESH"" from the store and what a difference in the eating! They will NEVER turn down this food.It has made a difference in the way they eat and when. We needed to get weight on them so they had to eat, and we started using it as a snack between meals. This changed to every meal as they would not walk away from it in the bowl. We add it to the kibble as you would a can and they eat it right up. THANKS from the senior greyhounds Tunes & Datz.",N,100,419

When I first sliced into the Freshpet and smelled the wonderful aroma, I knew Anna was in for a real treat. She was immediately at my side, patiently waiting, and seemed know it too. Cubed and mixed with her senior dry food, Anna cleaned her bowl which she has rarely done before. Suffice it to say that she loves it so far and I'm anxious to see how she reacts to your other products. Plus, I'm very interested to see any affects on her health.

Up until he was about two we had been feeding him solid gold mighty mini dry food (after trying several dry food varieties). We had to free feed because he would never eat enough in one sitting. Then we switched to Farmer's Dog, and he loved that, but it was just too expensive and kind of a hassle when he would sometimes run out before the next shipment. 
SO we found this and not only is it cheaper, he LOVES it. We have our Alexa remind us each evening to feed him, and you wouldn't believe how excited he gets when he here's the sound now. It's so nice to see him eat all his food every time.",Y,4,151

One has lost his teeth and now needs soft food as a result. but I did not want to buy one bag for one and then something esle for the other one plus I wanted to try more natural approach. They loved it immediately. They get so excited when it comes to meal time. My youngest chi is more playful and active and he’s a senior!. Though I must admit, there is a downside. The bag is way toooooo small and runs out a lot. I have to drive to the store almost every two weeks. That adds up. I really wish you guys made a bigger bag of fresh pet vitals small breed.

She also refuses wet food! Due to her dental issues, in the last year she has slowly refused more & more bowls of kibble with raw bits. The she started only eating the dehydrated bits. I found a little cup of mashed food she ate but suddenly refused & had issues. I then cooked boiled chicken, eggs & rice for a few days but I decided I didn't want her staying on it forever. I remembered the raw bits she always loved &amp; started looking at raw diets. Found a few online but I mainly like going to the pet store. Found this small breed raw diet she can solely be on. I love how you can see the carrots &amp; how it smells like chicken sausage! She devours this food like nothing else. No prep! No beef! No chewing problems or tummy issues! Yay! I even had to buy a measuring cup to make sure I didn't overfeed her. A bag last me about 5 days, it says use within a week of opening.

Freshpet® Vital™ Grain Free Complete Meals Small Breed Chicken All Life Stage Dog Food,4.7514792899408285,Loren,07-16-2018,Saved our dog's life!,"About a year ago, our senior dog (Bleu) was developing arthritis and has always had serious food allergies. We were always very limited in what we could feed him and we found that he just didn't like certain foods. As his arthritis worsened he began to skip meals because he simply didn't want to get up to eat. He began to lose weight because he would not eat. We started using Freshpet to mix with his food and the positive reaction was immediate. Even in pain he would bound out of his bed when he heard the package crinkle around meal time. We've since begun to manage his arthritis pain with medicine but there is no way we could ever stop feeding Bleu his Freshpet. He absolutely loves it! He gets happy feet when we scoop it into his dish and when we get the rolls he will literally scream and whine if we don't cut it up fast enough. His coat and his overall quality of life has improved greatly since we started feeding Freshpet. In my opinion, it is worth every penny and I recommend to every pet owner with a picky eater.",N,4,151

                    When he did eat he would take about 15 to 20 minutes to eat, and 3/4 of it was on the floor! He is mostly blind and deaf now and about a month ago he had a stroke or a seizure because he walked around half dead and would not eat his food. So our son told us about Freshpet Vital and after the first day he can't wait for his dinner!! When he eats now he goes into his bowl and does not come up until his bowl is empty.

He was surrendered to our local shelter having Hydrocephalus, a broken leg and a broken spirit. We hoped our 2 senior Chihuahuas would help him feel safe. We had no idea the huge personality that was hiding in this little guy!
                    
                    The veterinarian described him as ""dull"" and we figured it was his Hydrochephalus. The leg was an old injury. It healed basically forming a secondary wrist on that leg. His former owners had shaved his body so he was naked, cold and not wanting to eat. Sweaters became his signature look. FreshPet became his signature food.
                    
                    His fur has grown back in beautifully. He eats 1/3 cup 3x a day and lets out a satisfied burp each and every time. He's in the care of a Specialist to monitor his Hydrocephalus and any future problems we may encounter with his wonky leg. One of the main things she emphasized for his long-term care was to keep feeding him the FreshPet!",N,15,176

My German Shorthair went through a traumatic stomach problem and had an ulcer. She refused to eat any can dog food and would not touch her dry dog food. This is a dog that was never picky before her digestive upset. She was throwing up blood for awhile and lost a tremendous amount of weight. All I could get her to eat was cooked hamburger or chicken with rice and not much of that. I picked up a package of your chicken product and thought well it's expensive but if she will eat it it will be worth it to get something into her. I stared with a small amount and she kept it down so worked up. She never vomited any of it up. Fergie is starting on her third bag now and picking up some weight. I was almost sure I was going to have to put her down before she started eating your feed as she was so skinny. Thank you and keep up the good product. Sorry don't have a photo.,N,30,175

Freshpet® Vital ™ Grain Free Small Breed All Life Stage Dog Food,4.88,ChihuahuaMama,04-17-2021,The ONLY food my chihuahuas LOVE,"My boyfriend noticed the fridge in petsmart and encouraged me to try this small breed poultry recipe FreshPet food (he loves to spoil the chihuahuas and he thought the food looked amazing) but I was used to feeding RC kibble and cans, so I bought more RC and also this food. I have been back to the store many times now to purchase these rolls of FreshPet small breed POULTRY recipe. Both the chis go nuts at mealtime and finish every last bite and even lick the bowl clean! They LOVE THIS FOOD!
To be clear, I did try the small breed multi-protein roll and they ate it but did not love it. I’m sure some dogs out there like that one but mine love this poultry recipe. I also tried the small breed poultry recipe that comes in a bag and looks like soft fresh kibbles, and to be honest those soft fresh “kibbles” of food are too big for my chihuahua’s mouths so it isn’t that convenient for me because I have to break up every soft “kibble” in to two or three smaller pieces. But my dogs are tiny only 2lbs and 3lbs each so that is only a problem for tiny dogs like mine. 
I found myself online today hunting down more of these rolls of FreshPet small breed poultry recipe, because my dogs are in LOVE. I feel I have finally found the right food for them. We are all so happy!
Please consider offering routine home delivery in the future! I would sign up for that in a heartbeat. Currently (April 2021 Denver CO) I can only find it in fridges at petsmart and petco. I make it work though because my dogs love the food so much. So thank you FreshPet for making this food, you hit a home run with this one!! 
The food smells great, keeps well in the fridge for several days once opened (I throw it in a zip loc container) and the dogs’ poops are normal and their coats are healthy and the dogs are happy. I would highly recommend this food for other little dogs with picky or finicky appetites.",Y,7,79

No peas, plenty of Turkey, eggs, kale and all the good stuff out dogs need. In the early 2000’s, you had a study or two suggest that grains for dogs were bad. While I agree that a diet of just grains is not healthy, some grains are good. Following this study, all these dog food manufacturers decided to follow the trend and go “grain free.” Problem is, when they took out the grains, they didn’t fill the food in with other foods, meats, eggs, blueberries and kale, they filled it in with the cheapest option, a legume, PEAS! Peas and legumes are far worse for dogs, particularly when fed in such high concentrations, but they’re cheap and not a grain, so companies went with it, and a lot of companies went with it! Try and find a good today that doesn’t have peas in it.. go ahead, I will wait! It’s not easy. Unfortunately, the chicken version of VITAL has peas, but the Turkey does not, hence why I go Turkey!",Y,10,116

We started feeding him the same high quality kibble as our other pups. He would eat it for several weeks, then refuse it. We went through at least 10 high quality varieties, a combination of dry and wet foods. It was always the same pattern...happily eat for several weeks, then refuse. We would supplement with boiled fresh meats (ground turkey, etc). He would pick out the fresh meat and not eat the kibble or canned food. 
We finally tried Fresh Pet. 1 1/2 years later, and he’s at his ideal weight and enthusiastically eats Fresh Pet chicken and turkey, along with a bit of organic yogurt, every meal. He loves it...and even starts begging when he knows it’s breakfast and dinner time.

Freshpet® Vital™Balanced NutritionTurkey Adult Dog Food,4.813084112149533,Brittany,03-27-2019,Only buying this from now on!,"My 15 year-old pomeranian has issues digesting food, and she is normally fed a digestive prescription dog food from the vet. Last week, I ran out of her food and forgot to get some from the vet before they closed, so I went to Petco and searched high and low for a food similar enough to the Rx one. The FreshPet Turkey flavor was the closest I could find, and while I was apprehensive to suddenly change her diet (because even plain chicken and rice can make her flare up), I bought this food anyways. We're on day five now of her solely being on this food, and she has not had any diarrhea, no vomiting, her stomach isn't gurgling like crazy, and she's able to deficate properly. All of these things are shocking for a pup like her, because EVERYTHING makes her flare up, her stomach is so sensitive! I didn't even have to ween her off the Rx food, this food is reacting so well with her on its own, and she LOVES the flavor. In fact, she even barks and howls at me while I'm mushing it up for her, whereas with her other food I have to actually urge her to eat. I'm so glad I found this food, it makes me happy knowing she gets to comfortably splurge on something in her last stretch of life.",N,10,116

At a minimum I would estimate her age to be 11. She has always been very active and feisty, but over the past year she had developed some pain issues and was starting to act like she was ready to go. I took her to my vet who said her liver enzymes were elevated and suggested I spend $300 on an ultrasound. I decided to instead change her diet. She has been eating Vital Turkey and chicken for the past 6 months and she is a new dog! Her energy is back, she is extremely vocal at meal times, she bounces around, and is back to her formal youthful self. I am amazed and am going to switch my other three dogs to this food as well. There are not enough good things I can say about this food. It has literally given me my young girl back. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",N,10,116

                    Now two years later he is 110 - 115 pounds. This is still light for a male Presa but better for joints and heart. He is a very picky eater. We ran through several ""premium"" brands of dog food. He quickly became tired of each. Then we tried him on the 6 pound Vital Turkey roll. Oh boy! He gets 1 pound with his other foods every night. He is trim and shiny, his teeth stay clean, and he doesn't seem to tire of√Ç¬† Vital.",N,10,116
Freshpet® Vital™Balanced NutritionTurkey Adult Dog Food,4.813084112149533,DRP,08-18-2015,Bye bye picky eaters and allergies,"Having three dogs and interesting them to all eat has been a challenge over the years. My two malteses are very picky eaters and were never excited about food. I was always seeking healthy food they would eat. My Bichon, who was one of my foster dogs loved eating, but would throw up food and bite his paws. Toby had a rough start in life and came to us 3 years with many issues. We couldn't determine if his problems were from anxiety because of his past situation or the food he was on. My vet recommended Vital. I just can't believe how all three dogs are beyond excited to eat and no more allergy problems. No more tearing eyes causing streaking for my white babies and no more feet chewing. I even noticed their coats feel different and hair is healthier. Everyone always says I would do anything for my babies and they are right, only the best. Plus I know for a fact the better you feed them the healthier they will be and less vet bills. I only buy freshpet food and treats. They are crazy for everything. Thank you so much! Life is easier that Freshpet does the cooking.",N,10,116
Freshpet® Vital™Balanced NutritionTurkey Adult Dog Food,4.813084112149533,PWS,02-17-2015,Special Needs Finally Satified,"I have a puppy with special needs and one of her special needs is what her body could tolerate and digest nutritionally. I tried other brands of grain free foods, organic foods and nothing satisfied her nor met her needs until I found your brand. I had been told from a vet tech to try her on raw food but I wasn't told a brand. I researched and found your brand and all I can say is THANK YOU from both of us. I originally started her out on the grain free Vital chicken, beef, salmon, cranberry and spinach...she loved it but went through it so quickly and I could not find a place that carried the larger size, so the same vet tech told me to try your balanced Nutrition and see how she would do. That was our answer, she loves it and has thrived on it. She has more energy, and is digesting it better now that she has been on it for a bit. Her TCVM Vet is Very Pleased with her progress on the food. Now I have started my 11 year old beagle on it and he also is in love.",N,10,116
Freshpet® Vital™Balanced NutritionTurkey Adult Dog Food,4.813084112149533,Samantha,08-18-2014,Thank You Freshpet!,"Beni has had many tummy problems. She is very sensitive to even the highest quality foods if they contain even the slightest amount of poultry or poultry fat. This has affected her health. We struggled for months, actually well over a year, along with uncomfortable tests and expensive vet bills, trying to help her obtain good health. Many people declare that raw is the answer, but raw foods upset her precious tummy. Not just poultry, but all raw meats made her ill. Our sweet little girl was so shaky and scared of everything; poor baby didn't feel well. Strolling through the pet store, we saw the fridge and took a look. It was worth a try, so we put a log of Bison Vitals in our cart and headed home. She LOVED it and would you believe no upset tummy! Amazing!!! We have tried every flavor of Freshpet Vitals; her favorite flavor is TURKEY. Yes, turkey! We never thought she would ever be able to eat turkey, but she enjoys it so much and has no upset tummy! Beni THRIVES on Freshpet. Her body looks full and healthy. Her coat is gorgeous. Along with her body feeling better, she has gained great confidence and boldness. Characteristics of the breed. Our little princess has gone on to become a grand champion and one of the top ten Shibas in the US! Thank you Freshpet! You gave Beni the life she deserves.",N,10,116

He barks at his plate when he wants more. Jojo is a very, very picky eater, sometimes I would mix his dog food with a baked chichen breast or liver cheese just to get him to eat. I don't have to mix anything with Freshpet and he cleans his plate every time. He's made me feel so guilty because I didn't think of this sooner.

VooDoo has never been jazzed about any food other than the food he stole from the talble. The first time I brough Fresh Pet home and began to put it in his bowl the drooling starting. Voodoo now begins to salivate the second I open his drawer on the fridge and finished eating before I get the rest of the food wrapped and back in the drawer.

Not to be graphic but her stool (on a good day) was typically the consistency of mashed potatoes -- sometimes worse -- and it was leading to issues with her glands. After a couple DAYS of feeding Freshpet Deli Fresh Turkey Rice and Vegetable, her stool was for lack of a better word, perfect. And it has remained perfect for the entire two months we've been feeding her this product. And now since her stool is the correct consistency her glands are emptying properly.

Our own Dogue de Bordeaux has an intolerance for kibble which he vomits due to his small esophagus, but when mixed with Deli Fresh, water, and a little chicken and rice, he gets a fully balanced meal twice a day which stays down.

I have tried numerous brands and types of dog food (freeze dried, kibble, canned, dry), he would eat one meal then turn up his nose to it. Feeding him was a daily chore and often a disappointing one. He ate to live - he did not live to eat.   I tried the Grain Free Vital Beef & Bison first and then The Grain Free Turkey. Teddy now eats when I put the bowl down and sometimes eats 3 meals a day.  I don't have to coax him to eat by putting treats on top and I don't have to throw away uneaten food.  He has more energy than he has had in a long time. He is more active and seems happier. This food has changed both of our lives, Teddy's AND mine. So glad I gave it a try. Teddy even liked the Grain Free cat food that I bought by mistake. LOL!",Y,0,36

Freshpet® Vital™Grain Free Turkey Adult Dog Food,4.784810126582278,Heather,09-22-2019,Freshpet saved us!,"My Pitbull Otis had many digestive problems when I adopted him. I tried every food I could think of, including vet recommended food, in small amounts with time to adjust. Nothing worked. I then spent 3 years cooking for my dog. During a camping trip this summer it was clear we needed a simpler option, so I started with a small tube of Bison suggested by a pet store employee. The dog loved it! The even better news is that his digestive issues went away almost over night! My only issue with that specific protein is how expensive it is for my dog (Otis is about 75 lbs). We've been able to switch to VITAL¬Æ GRAIN FREE TURKEY RECIPE WITH SPINACH, CRANBERRIES & BLUEBERRIES. However, it's only available in the smaller 2lb package (1 tube lasts 2 days). He's unable to eat the other formula of Turkey with peas and carrots, so I hope at some point a larger size will be an option.",N,0,36

Freshpet® Vital™Grain Free Turkey Adult Dog Food,4.784810126582278,Jersey,05-07-2017,I use to make my own food,"For years I made my dogs food, which took hours. I use to make sure it had all the vitamins and nutrition needed. I started doing this because there were too many recalls, plus I didn't like canned food and wanted a fresh meal for my babies. My vet started carrying Fresh Pet and I noticed it in the refrigerator. I asked about it and was told how amazing the food was. My vet thought it was one of the best-inspired products on the market. I decided to try it. Now remember my 3 angels where spoiled and use to home cooking. They immediately loved this new food and treats. So at first I thought they would tire of it after awhile, but it has been 6 years. The beauty of this product is they have different meat and fish proteins. The vegetables and fruit along with the protein are perfect together. I believe in variety, so I have tried them all. Plus going back and forth among their products you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to worry about changing, my dogs have never had issues. My guys like the vital turkey with spinach, cranberries and blueberries the best. Second favorite is Vital chicken. Anyone who has a Bichon or Maltese knows they can be a little picky, not in our house as plates are clean. We recently adopted another rescue who is a Westipoo. Poor little guy was under weight and his hair looked awful. 6 weeks of fresh pet he is full of energy, eating great and his hair looks healthy already. As they say you are what you eat and I totally believe better food leads to healthy and happy pups. Not to mention less visits to the vet.The company has fantastic customer service if you ever have any questions.",N,0,36

I have been unable to get him to eat any of his regular food or the ""bland diet"" which is boiled hamburger and rice or scrambled eggs and rice. I was getting desperate to find something he would eat. My local Tractor Supply Company had just gotten their Freshpet cooler. I took home some of the Vital grain free turkey. It wasn't looking good at first; he left some pieces on the floor and I put his bowl in the fridge. He went back to the pieces about an hour later and ate them! I pulled the bowl out of the fridge and he finished the bowl. I gave him a little more before bed and he was able to keep it all in his belly instead of all over the yard. Its going to be difficult to get Parker to eat dry kibble again after this but I'm glad he's eating something. Thank You Freshpet!",N,0,36

So we are going to start feeding home cooked meals and supplements and add these to his diet.  I started him on this by adding 1/4 lb to his kibble whle weaning him off of it.  He will not even let me get it into his bowl before he is trying to get it from me.  My pit is pouting by her food bowl because she smells his and knows hers is not the same.  So I guess we are starting her on it too.  It is a fan favorite in my house.  Hoping it helps with skin and allergies.

Let me start by saying I have an 11 year old male shitzu, Georgie. G was having some skin issues, similar to doggie eczema. He had hair loss and some lesions/dry skin areas. This food was recommended to me by another customer when I was at petsmart. I brought it home and my dog went BANANAS for it! It is on the lower end of the protein scale (which is good for an older dog) and it has a high moisture content. Georgie was never the kind of dog to sit in the kitchen at 5pm and wait for dinner but, now he is. My 11 year old little man is like a puppy again. His energy is 5x what it was prior to this food. His hair is thick, and long and his skin is clear of lesions or any type of issue. This food has biotin in it and other vitamins that I think have been extremely beneficial to his health and well-being. I give him a little bit of dry food (blue buffalo, grain free salmon flavor) to go along with this food and he loves it. (The salmon is also great for coat etc.) I also highly reccommend the Fresh Pet treats. According to Georgie, the turkey bacon is amazing! :)",Y,22,141

Dog Nation(r) Fresh Adult Dog Treat - Chicken,4.763636363636364,Happypupper,12-18-2022,Doggone good!,"First bought these for my pup to use as a “treat” with his meds. He quickly fell in love with them and now they are a regular part of his routine. They are soft & moist, making them great for his few remaining teeth to chew. Or they can easily be cut up and added into his food bowl. They don’t smell appealing to me (strong vinegar scent when opening the bag). They also do loose moisture with time and become a little less appealing to him , so I would recommend following the 7-10 days of use after opening. Overall they’re fairly clean ingredients (no added oils, flavors, or colorings) and soy/grain free for my pup and his very sensitive tummy/dietary needs. Just wish they were not so pricey or came in additional size bags. For reference my dog is approx 20lb small breed and only gets 1- 1 1/2 links a day with his meds.

I can never get through a whole bag in 10 days. It’s far too many. It’s very wasteful. I’ve also tried dog joy… Whether it’s the bacon or the chicken snacks there is far too many unless that’s the only thing I’m ever feeding him. I won’t buy it again because I feel like I’m throwing out at least 1/3 of the package constantly. I would only recommend it if you had multiple dogs or a larger pet,N,0,15

Since we live in an apartment, we take her out on a LOT of walks, and went through the rescue's provided treats in a couple of days. Because they can't give us supplies often, I was looking for something cheap and low value, but also a similar texture and flavour to the treats she had before. 

Since we're dealing with COVID-19 stuff going on, I had to order from PetSmart's website for curbside pickup. I've never been good at online shopping (despite my status as ""millennial/Gen-Z cusper"") and didn't really know what I was buying, but I'm so glad I added these to my cart! I feel good about giving her healthy treats, and she's so much more focused now. I can see in a few days that her training is starting to stick faster. I didn't think about it while ordering, but I think she was being stubborn because she wanted something tastier! 

I would definitely recommend these treats to anyone looking for a healthy and natural training treat! They do have a wet texture which causes the smell to stick to your hands, but I've found even the smell can grab her attention during walks if I need to break her focus off something. As well, the texture makes it easy to break in half, so we can use one per walk and make them last a bit longer. I put the second half in a small tupperware and put it in my pocket for the end of the walk. They're easy to get, don't cost much more than similar sized bags of other treats, and its worth it to me to pay a couple extra dollars to give her something that's healthy and works so well for training. My only negative is that they aren't Canadian, produced here, or available at the Canadian pet store near me, but again, I'm willing to look past that for her.",Y,0,15

Freshpet® Vital™ Grain Free Complete Meals Beef with Lamb Adult Dog Food,4.722222222222222,John,10-14-2017,A Happy Ending..,"This past year has been extremely difficult for our family. In September of 2016 our dog, Rusty, began acting strange. We observed changes in appetite and behavior. We questioned if it had something to do with the 6mo old puppy Rusty was now sharing his home with. But that wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it, Rusty loved having a playmate.It felt like we were at the vets daily trying to figure out what was happening. Blood work and urine analyses kept coming back normal. Then on October 8, 2016 the lights went out. Rusty stood frozen in the corner paralyzed by fear. We rushed him to the vet to learn he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d lost his vision. Further testing revealed changes in appetite and behavior were a result of high blood pressure which would lead to his blindness.Following his diagnosis, things were very different. Aside from the addition of pet ramps and daily blood pressure medicine, we saw a major change in Rusty√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s digestion. He couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t keep any food down. We tried every combination of chicken and rice, pumpkin and sweet potato. We added supplements and probiotics. Nothing worked. Then we found Freshpet. Since switching over to your product, Rusty has not only found digestive relief, he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s begun gaining back the weight he lost.My husband teaches second grade and I run a local mental health clinic. We make a living caring for others. Freshpet has reminded us that there are people out there doing the same for our furry family members. We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had to budget to allow for this premium dog food. Having given Rusty his life back, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been well worth it! Next week our pup turns 12.. we owe that, in part, to you...

Until one day I went to pet smart to pick up royal canin dog food to see if she would eat that, and that's where I saw it on the refrigerated section. So I said to myself it wouldn't hurt to try and if she doesn't like it I can just return it. Went home and she loved it. Ate everything and now after a couple of weeks she can't get enough of it.

So far this Beef and Lamb seems to be helping and she loves it. My other pup has been on raw and I added this in as a healthy alternative. He loves it so much and in my opinion the quality is just as good as raw with less worry about contamination. They almost knock me over for this food - it's insane - they love it. I'm glad this doesn't contain chicken so they both can enjoy it! I hope FP comes out with a product in this consistency that is just fish protein as another alternative in the future.

                    Our dog, Hinkley, is 9 years old and with that comes a few issues here and there. As a rescue his teeth were neglected and needed 8 removed before we could take him home. In September we noticed some food issues with Hinkley. Thinking maybe he didn't like that kind anymore we would switch to something else in order to add it to his dry dog food. Things became more and more laborous and we would be on pins and needles to see if he would eat. He would go days without eating. He started losing weight and then intestinal issues krept in to the already difficult situation. He usually would scarf down chicken and rice when all else failed, but even that came to a hault. We knew we had to do something because his intestinal issues and stool were becoming worse and worse. Our vet did some blood work and it came back low in the B vitamins. Considering he wasn't eating well we thought it might be because of that. We hoped it was just lack of B-12 and not anything else. In the meantime he was scheduled for his annual dental. Guess what???? He had a bad tooth! One of his fangs was causing much problems and needed to be pulled. After he recovered from the dental and started him on B-12 shots/supplements we noticed a vast improvement. But now to figure out a food he would eat. Still not keen on just soft food and I tried every brand I could think of, our vet suggested looking in the refrigerated section. Bingo!!!! On a whim I just grabbed the smallest, cheapest of the FreshPet options because I didn't know if he would like it. At first he didn't bother, so I wrapped it in lunch meat and fed it to him, then by itself. He now eats the dog food down with no problem. We are ecstatic! In the 4 years we have had him we have not seen him devour the same type/brand of food on a consistent basis. 
                    Eternally grateful pet parents.",N,1,11

It even became so worrisome that the vet considered various scans and testing to see if there was something internal supressing his appetite. The day I found your chicken/beef/salmon/egg recipe, I was at the end of my rope. Then...it happened! I put the food in Jackson's bowl and he DEVOURED it! Initially I thought, ""maybe he's just really hungry today...this won't last, it's not possible!"" Well, here we are almost 2 years later, and Jackson still runs to the bowl everytime the bag of food comes out of the fridge!

I did everything my vet told me to do. I fed a prescription diet, tested and gave them insulin shots twice a day. In the last two years we have not been able to stabilize either my boy or his mother. I resigned myself to the fact I would never get either dog's diabetes under control, that was until recently. My husband and I went out of town and my 14 year-old took a turn for the worst. Her blood sugar sky rocketed and she stopped eating. My friend who was taking care of my four Labradors decided to find a new food she would eat. She brought home Freahpet Vital. My old girl loved it. The best part this food began lowering her blood sugar. The last two weeks my old girls blood sugar has been more consistent and she has been getting stronger. Today we began giving this same food to my other diabetic dog and we are hoping for the same results. i will have to keep you posted.",N,1,11

Ever since Sable was a baby she had stomach issues-it seemed that every food made her sick after a few days. Perhaps because of this she was the pickiest eater ever! No matter what I gave her she would turn her little nose up and walk away. The vet put her on a special bland diet which took away the stomach issues but she hated it! Mealtimes were miserable. One day my friend Jason (dogfood whisperer)brought us Freshpet. And Sable loved it! Even better, there were no stomach issues. She gobbles it up. Her eyes sparkle and her fur is...well, like Sable! Thank you SO MUCH for making such a great dog food! Sable √¢√π_√Ø¬∏√® Freshpet",N,1,11

He had diarrhea off and on constantly since the day I picked him up. After a few months his vet prescribed him science diet z/d to hopefully get his stools under control. We only had little success. So one day we were getting to the end of a bag of the z/d and I decided to pick up some freshpet instead of buy another $90 bag of z/d. It was like an overnight miracle. His stools were normal for the first time in almost a year! We are truly grateful for freshpet and the great food they make!,N,1,11

"Freshpet® Vital™Grain Free Chicken, Beef, Salmon & Egg Adult Dog Food",4.881578947368421,Barb,09-27-2016,"Our ""miracle"" dog","In April of 2014, our sweet 8 year old Doberman Hershey was diagnosed with hemangiosarcoma, a nasty and fatal cancer. He was bleeding internally and close to death, but we decided to go through with surgery. The surgery successfully removed the hemorrhaging tumor, but we were given a life expectancy of 18 -72 days. We were told that anymore than that would be a blessing. We did two things: first, we prayed like crazy and asked family and friends prayed for us also; second, we added Vital to Hershey's diet. His favorites included one with salmon and with eggs. Everynight, I would ask him if he wanted to show me something, and he would run to the refrigerator where the Vital was kept. We just assumed this would be a short, sweet phase before he passed away. 18 months later...YES, 18 months later Hershey was still ""showing me something"" every night, running to the refrigerator for more Vital. Our vet referred to Hershey as a miracle dog! Not only did he live that long but it was a good 18 months of daily walks, laying in the sun, barking at the neighborhood cats, playing with the neighborhood dogs! After 18 months, he developed a second tumor which ruptured and within just a few hours we were saying our final goodbyes. So, I'm convinced our prayers brought us to Vital and gave us the time to develop peace and grace when it was time to put Hershey to sleep. I've read a few negative reviews on snobby-dog blogs, as if somehow these self-proclaimed experts would never give Vital to their dogs for some sobby reason. Look, Doberman owners tend to be pretty snobby ourselves, but I would recommend Vital to anyone, especially anyone with a sick dog. Thank you Vital for 18 more months!!",N,1,11

For sure required a food that would not crumble into tiny bits and get into his sinus. The pup was not doing well, with stomach issues and of course could not latch on to his mom. I had already tried, with success, vital raw foods for my adult dogs, and noticed your soft kibble like foods in the cold section at the pet store.The pup only weighed 7 oz at 5 wks old, he was gaining less than an ounce per week, and really needed to gain some weight. I cut up the soft kibbles so he could manage the size without chewing. He has been on this diet now for a week and thriving well. He is now 10 oz. I was concerned about constipation, and his stool is fine now on this diet. I also introduced the same food to the rest of the litter and they all love it and are doing well. As well I now feed this same recipe to the adult dogs, with no issues from switching foods.There was no other soft kibble at any of the stores in my area, not even a soft cat kibble (except for vital, which I would had tried) for my special pup.Thank you for making this healthy, nutritious, grain free, easy to feed dog food!",N,1,11

My husband and I joke that it's like the movie Cocoon! He hasn't had this much spunk and energy in years. His arthritis pain seems to have halved since he's been eating the food. And he can't gobble up the food fast enough -- he LOVES it!! We've also noticed that his bowel movements are much more routine and healthy (for lack of better word).

It made him sick, resulting in vomiting and diarrhoea. His appetite waned, and he began losing weight. Euthanasia became a likely prospect, since he was suffering and there seemed no treatment that would correct the problem. Even my vets were stymied.Then I came across Freshpet's ad and decided to try their food. The Vital food seemed appropriate and since I started him on it, he absolutely has thrived.

Those would get pricey since I had to give him 2-3 tubs a day. Then I tried Freshpet Vital Fresh cuts and he loved it! Had to cut up the big pieces, and added some warm water to make it more stew-like, but I didn't mind that. But then I couldn't find it any more. So I tried this version, fingers crossed. I still added some water just because he seems to prefer wetter food. Well he loves it! And the smaller chunks are easy for him to eat. He leaves nothing behind in his dish. Also, it's less expensive than the Fresh Cuts, and comes in a larger quantity. I'm so glad I tried this, and so is my dog.",Y,0,17

I use it to mix into his prescription kidney disease food (which REALLY doesn't taste good at all) and I need it to motivate him to eat.  This stuff really does!  The smell is good, even to me, and so is the consistency.  Easy to get out of the package, not pasty or watery.  I also like that I can give him some more healthful than canned or dry kibble without having to receive the big boxes of frozen stuff with all the wasted packaging.

Freshpet® Nature's Fresh With-Grains Beef All Life Stage Dog Food,4.8,MarshallP,07-09-2021,My 14 year old palliative dog is eating again!!!!,"Hello to you wonderful people! I have a video I wanted to share. I have a little guy named Marshall who was diagnosed with stage 3 mass cell cancer 7 years ago. We had already lost our chocolate lab to this a year earlier. We decided to do the surgery for Marshall as he was only 5 years old. A huge portion of his back was removed and recovery was difficult but he made it. We had been told that the cancer will return at some point as theres no cure, but he has made it another 7 years which is unheard of. In september 2020, we had to take him in, he wasn't doing well. He had a massive tutor in his abdomen and we were told he's palliative. We gave him anything the wanted, bacon, hot dogs, burgers, ground chicken, ground turkey and he loves fresh veggies. 4 months ago we had to say goodbye to our Jack Russel Daisy (wiggles) after 17 years and Marshall took it hard. He was literally a skeleton, barely eating and couldn't gain weight. We tried EVERYTHING to put some weight on. 

We have seen the ""freshpet"" commercials for months but it didn't click until last week and we thought ""what the hell, might as well try"". HE GOBBLED IT UP! He has started barking agin for the first time in 4 months AND he does his ""food dance"" when i'm cutting up his breakfast and dinner for the first time in 16 months!

He's put on 1lb already and we can't see his ribs anymore! 

Thank you so so so much for giving us a little more time with our boy and making him happy dance for his food!!!!!

Freshpet® Nature's Fresh Grain Free Chicken All Life Stage Dog Food,4.583333333333333,Lauren,03-24-2017,From tired cancer patient to frisky happy pup!,"Our little 6lb rescue chihuahua Orion has never been one to enjoy meal time. He shied away from his bowl no matter what we fed him. Sometimes we could coax him with a new wet food for a day or two but then it was back to not eating and hiding at meal time. When Orion was diagnosed with cancer we knew we needed him to have a healthy diet to keep him strong through his treatments. After trying so many different healthy food options, I came across the Freshpet stews. We had success! Even when he was tired and hurting Orion would eat a generous portion. Now in remission, he is like a new dog. He barks eagerly jumping up and down to let us know he is ready for his meals and gobbles up every bite. He has gained a full pound and his tiny little spine and hip bones are no longer visible. Orion is now a happy, frisky pup with tons of energy and a big appetite! I am so happy with his turnaround it brings tears to my eyes. I only wish we would have found Freshpet sooner, because after six years of ownership and battling cancer, our eight year old dog now acts like a puppy. We can't thank you enough and please don't ever stop making the chicken and beef stews!",N,2,9

Up until this point I have never met a dog who didn't enjoy their food to the point of inhaling it. This puppy threw me for a curve when she would refuse food or not finish her food. We decided to try Freshpet and she LOVES it. We mixed it with her old brand and she would just eat the Freshpet leaving the kibble behind. She enjoys eating now and runs to her kennel when it is time to eat. She has not had any upset stomach due to the transition either.

As soon as I opened the bag Oscar was interested. I was impressed, too: even the best dog foods usually smell pretty funky to me, but this one smelled delicious, and I don't even eat meat.

I switched her over to Freshpet about 2 years ago and haven't looked back. I just noticed the new version of the mini nugget in the Whole Foods in Friendship Heights, DC store and hope its carried throughout all Whole Foods in the metro DC area. I've noticed the other Fresphpet options at the Unleashed by Petco and other pet stores but this is the only variety of Freshpet she goes for.She absolutely loves it and usually comes back to her bowl looking for more. I like it since I no longer have to cut up the log version, just scoop and go. So yes, I'm a big fan of this Freshpet brand and would recommended to any pet owner.LisaSilver Spring, MD",N,0,0
"Freshpet® Nature's Fresh All Life Stage Dog Food - With-Grain, Chicken",4.909090909090909,Lauren,03-24-2017,From tired cancer patient to frisky happy pup!,"Our little 6lb rescue chihuahua Orion has never been one to enjoy meal time. He shied away from his bowl no matter what we fed him. Sometimes we could coax him with a new wet food for a day or two but then it was back to not eating and hiding at meal time. When Orion was diagnosed with cancer we knew we needed him to have a healthy diet to keep him strong through his treatments. After trying so many different healthy food options, I came across the Freshpet stews. We had success! Even when he was tired and hurting Orion would eat a generous portion. Now in remission, he is like a new dog. He barks eagerly jumping up and down to let us know he is ready for his meals and gobbles up every bite. He has gained a full pound and his tiny little spine and hip bones are no longer visible. Orion is now a happy, frisky pup with tons of energy and a big appetite! I am so happy with his turnaround it brings tears to my eyes. I only wish we would have found Freshpet sooner, because after six years of ownership and battling cancer, our eight year old dog now acts like a puppy. We can't thank you enough and please don't ever stop making the chicken and beef stews!",N,0,0

Up until this point I have never met a dog who didn't enjoy their food to the point of inhaling it. This puppy threw me for a curve when she would refuse food or not finish her food. We decided to try Freshpet and she LOVES it. We mixed it with her old brand and she would just eat the Freshpet leaving the kibble behind. She enjoys eating now and runs to her kennel when it is time to eat. She has not had any upset stomach due to the transition either. Working in the pet industry I have researched alot of pet foods and we are very pleased with this food. My only worry is Willow will not eat an entire bag within the 7 days so we may have to try freezing some of it.,N,0,0

There are several options out there and we tried them all. Unfortunately, my pup didn't take to any of them. She'd leave her bowl relatively untouched and was falling underweight. I found this food in the Whole Foods refrigerated pet section and decided, despite the steep price tag, to try it. Just upon opening the bag you can see and smell the difference - real chunks of meat and visible bits of veggies. It actually smells good. My pup now eagerly devours every meal.

"Freshpet Nature's Fresh All Life Stage Dog Food - Grain Free, Turkey",5.0,mattydubs,10-03-2016,Hard to Teach An Old Dog...,"After my fifteen year old Jack Russel had AVVI, he became very picky about what he ate. Part of this is due to the medication he is on, but he lost four pounds (down from twenty to sixteen, which would be akin to me, a 145 pound man losing 29 pounds... I'd look like a skeleton, if I didn't just die) when he quit eating the food he was accustomed to (dry). We had some luck with a dehydrated brand that the pet store three blocks away recommended, but after a bout of nausea, he refused to eat it at all. I'll be frank, perhaps this is what happens when you live in the middle of a city, but the owners of that store pooh-poohed Nature's Fresh. ""It's precooked, it's not natural."" Fine. But this is what my dog will eat.I have no such complaints about Nature's Fresh. Sure, it's something you can buy at Whole Foods, but it's the only way we can get our old man to eat. He loves it. He whines (which he never does for any other reason) when I start mashing it up. It is his absolute favorite.I am sure that all dogs can benefit from Nature's Fresh, but honestly, it seems to be very popular with older dogs who have digestive issues. He's still not up to weight, but he has slowly been getting close and there is no way he would have gotten there without it. Kudos to y'all for your good work. Hell, I have tried a bite and it, unlike dry food, is something I could eat, sort of like Mad Max did in The Roadwarrior. (I always try a nibble of my dog's food when we try something new... I'm eternally curious.)",N,0,0
"Freshpet Nature's Fresh All Life Stage Dog Food - Grain Free, Turkey",5.0,UB,12-28-2015,Tempermental Tummy,"My 17 lb. Pomeranian has had tummy issues on and off. We will go through a day of nausea and vomit to the point of her vomiting bile, then off feed for up to two days. I have always had her on grain free, but after her episodes, it was always difficult to get her back on her diet. There was always the slow transition with rice, finding a supplemental canned food to mix in, adding in her dry. I hated the canned food and after one of her episodes, she hated her dry food so I was at a loss. I did some research on raw and making it myself (realistically, I knew that was never gonna happen) when I came across reviews for Pet Fresh√Ç¬†grain free. So, I went out and bought a log and the rest is history. We did go back and forth between the Vital and the Nature's Fresh and have settled on the Nature's Fresh, mostly the chicken (the salmon smells way too fishy). When she is hungry, she barks up a storm waiting for me to get her meal ready, and there is not a piece left in the bowl when she is done. On occasion, she will still have an episode, an unfortunate predisposition. However with some anti-nausea medication and Freshpet it's much easier to get her back on track to her regular diet.

About two years ago he developed chronic nausea and had fits of vomiting resulting in aspirational pneumonia. He was on anti nausea medication, antacids and cough medicine twice a day for two years and still had fits of vomiting requiring injections to stop them. His coughing and hacking kept the entire pack up all night. I have changed his diet a number of times with pricey canned and limited ingredient dry foods with no change in his health. I thought the end was near.My holistic veterinarian suggested I change his diet to a freshly prepared home made diet. I instead tried Freshpet for the convenience.
